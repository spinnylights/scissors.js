# Scissors.js

Scissors.js is a library for making literary cut-ups, Ã  la [William Burroughs](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/burroughs-cutup.html) or [Tristan Tzara](http://www.in-vacua.com/tzara.shtml).

To install, clone this repo or:

```bash
wget https://github.com/zaaanderson/scissors.js/raw/master/scissors-min.js
```

then include scissors-min.js in your project.

All the functions are stored in a global object called `Siz`. To use, say, `shuffleWords()`, call `Siz.shuffleWords("the string to shuffle")`.

## Functions

* [shuffleWords()](#scrambleWords)

### reverseWords(*string*)

Returns *string* with its words reversed. Splits on spaces.

#### Example:

### shuffleLines(*string*)

Formats the string as if it were laid out on a page, then shuffles the order of the "lines". Respects word breaks.

#### Example:

### burSpl(*string*)

Formats the string as if it were laid out on a page, then cuts the virtual page into four equally-sized pieces, shuffles the pieces, and stitches them back together. Doesn't respect word breaks.

This is an accurate reproduction of the Burroughs-Gysin cut-up method. Burroughs liked the way that split-up words would be combined to make new words.
